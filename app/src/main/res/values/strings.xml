    <string name="powered_by">This technology is brought to you by Nuchwezi ICT Research Labs.
        \n\nThe basic idea behind TRAY, is to create a mobile app that allows one to keep track of a stream of time-stamped strings.
        \n\nSO HOW COULD IT HELP YOU?
        \n\nSimple - note taking, TODO lists, collecting research material (using the \"share to TRAY\" for text from other apps), and many other things.
        \n\nNote that there\'s support for Markdown and basic HTML, so you can created well formatted notes if you know some of that stuff too.
