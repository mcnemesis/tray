        \n\nThe basic idea behind TRAY, is to create a tool that allows one to generate, store, share and analyze a stream of time-stamped strings. In the world of TRAY, we call them "meta eggs", and one could think of a meta egg as a self-contained, particular string with a high information density.
        \n\nSO HOW COULD IT HELP YOU?
        \n\nNote taking, TODO lists, bookmarking important things, collecting research material (using the \"share to TRAY\" for text from other apps), and many other things.
        \n\nSomeone has called TRAY their "living diary", private and secure indeed.
        \n\nNote that there\'s support for Markdown and basic HTML, so you can create well formatted notes if you know some of that stuff too.
