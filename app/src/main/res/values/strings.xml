        \n\nThe basic idea behind TRAY, is to create a mobile app that allows one to keep track of a stream of time-stamped strings.
        \n\nSO HOW COULD IT HELP YOU?
        \n\nIf you are walking down the street, and come to some restaurant you\'d wish to visit some day in the near future, you could merely
        note its name down, and then some day later, merely consult the date-time sorted list of stored items in TRAY, for the name and whatever other notes about the place that you saved around that time.
